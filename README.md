# Money

Money is a Swift framework for iOS, watchOS, tvOS and OS X. It provides types and functionality to represent, calculate and convert money in the 298 [ISO currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217). 

## Usage

The Money framework defines the type `Money`, which represents money in the device‚Äôs current locale. The following code:

```swift
let money: Money = 100
print("I'll give \(money) to charity.‚Äù)
```

will print out

> I'll give $100.00 to charity 

when the region is set to United States

> I'll give ¬£100.00 to charity

when the region is set to United Kingdom

> I'll give CN¬•100.00 to charity

when the region is set to China

You get the idea.

`Money` is `IntegerLiteralConvertible` and  `FloatLiteralConvertible`. Which means values can be initialized using literal `Int`s and `Double`s as shown in these code snippets.

## Specific Currency

Under the hood, `Money` is a `typealias` for `_Money<Currency.Local>` where `Currency.Local` is a specific `CurrencyType` which represents the currency for the current local. This means that it is strongly typed to the local currency.

In a similar way, there are 298 foreign currency types supported.

```swift
let pounds: GBP = 99.99
let euros: EUR = 149.50

print(‚ÄúYou have \(pounds / 2) and \(euros + 30)‚Äù)
```

> You have ¬£¬†50.00 and ‚Ç¨¬†179.50

Because the currencies are typed, it means that they cannot be combined together.

```swift
let money = pounds + euros
```
> Binary operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'GBP' (aka '_Money&lt;Currency.GBP&gt;') and 'EUR' (aka '_Money&lt;Currency.EUR&gt;')

Of course, `Money` supports the usual suspects of decimal arithmetic operators, so you can add, subtract, multiply, divide values of the same type, and values with `Int` and `Double` with some limitations.

## Foreign Currency Exchange (FX)
To represent a foreign exchange transaction, i.e. converting `USD` to `EUR`, use a FX service provider. There is built in support for [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter/#from=USD;to=EUR;amt=1) and [OpenExchangeRates.org](https://openexchangerates.org) services. But it‚Äôs possible for consumers to create their own too.

The following code snippet represent a currency exchange using Yahoo‚Äôs currency converter.

```swift
Yahoo<USD,EUR>.quote(100) { result in
    if let (dollars, quote, euros) = result.value {
        print("Exchanged \(dollars) into \(euros) with a rate of \(quote.rate)")
    }
}
```

> Exchanged US$¬†100.00 into ‚Ç¨¬†92.15 with a rate of 0.9215

The result, delivered asynchronously, uses [`Result`](http://github.com/antitypical/Result) to encapsulate either a tuple value `(BaseMoney, FXQuote, CounterMoney)` or an `FXError` value. Obviously, in real code - you‚Äôd need to check for errors ;)

There is a neat convenience function which just returns the `CounterMoney` as its `Result` value type.

```swift
Yahoo<USD,EUR>.fx(100) { euros in
    print("You got \(euros)")
}
```

> You got .Success(‚Ç¨¬†92.15)


### Creating custom FX service providers

Creating a custom FX service provider is straightforward. The protocols `FXLocalProviderType` and `FXRemoteProviderType` define the minimum requirements. The `fx` method is provided via extensions on the protocols.

For a remote FX service provider, i.e. one which will make a network request to get a rate, we can look at the `Yahoo` provider to see how it works.

Firstly, we subclass the generic class `FXRemoteProvider`. The generic types are both constrained to `MoneyType`. The naming conventions follow those of a [currency pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_pair).

```swift
public class Yahoo<B: MoneyType, C: MoneyType>: FXRemoteProvider<B, C>, FXRemoteProviderType {
    // etc
}
```

`FXRemoteProvider` provides the typealiases for `BaseMoney` and `CounterMoney` which will be needed to introspect the currency codes.

The protocol requires that we can construct a `NSURLRequest`.

```swift
public static func request() -> NSURLRequest {
  return NSURLRequest(URL: NSURL(string: "https://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=\(BaseMoney.Currency.code)\(CounterMoney.Currency.code)=X&f=nl1")!)
}
```

The last requirement, is that the network result can be mapped into a `Result<FXQuote,FXError>`.

`FXQuote` is a class (so it can be subclassed if needed), which composes the exchange rate to be used. The rate is a `BankersDecimal` (see below on the decimal implementation details).

```swift
public static func quoteFromNetworkResult(result: Result<(NSData?, NSURLResponse?), NSError>) -> Result<FXQuote, FXError> {
  return result.analysis(
    ifSuccess: { data, response in
      let rate: BankersDecimal = 1.5 // or whatever	 
      return Result(value: FXQuote(rate: BankersDecimal(floatLiteral: rate)))
    },
    ifFailure: { error in
      return Result(error: .NetworkError(error))
    }
  )
}
```

Note that the provider doesn‚Äôt need to perform any networking itself. It is all done by the framework. This is a deliberate architectural design as it makes it much easier to unit test the adaptor code.

Additionally FX APIs will be added shortly,
1.  To calculate the reverse exchange, i.e. how many dollars would I need to get so many euros.
2.  For the two (forward & reverse) exchanges, I‚Äôll also add a `quote` function, which will return the `FXQuote` object. This might be useful if your app needs to persist the quote used for an exchange.

# Creating custom currencies

If your app has its own currency e.g. ‚≠êÔ∏ès or üíés or even üêùs, you might want to consider making a type for it.

Lets imagine we‚Äôre making *Hive.app* - where you compete with your friends to see who can get the biggest hive (measured in number of üêùs).

To create a custom currency, just conform to `CurrencyType`. 

```swift
protocol HiveCurrencyType: CurrencyType { }

extension Currency {
    final class Bee: HiveCurrencyType {

        static let code: String = "BEES"
        static let symbol: String = "üêù"
        static let scale: Int  = 0
        static let formatter: NSNumberFormatter = {
            let fmtr = NSNumberFormatter()
            fmtr.numberStyle = .CurrencyStyle
            fmtr.maximumFractionDigits = Currency.Bee.scale
            fmtr.currencySymbol = Currency.Bee.symbol
            return fmtr
        }()
    }
}

typealias Bees = _Money<Currency.Bee>
```

Just make sure that your currency code doesn‚Äôt clash with a real one - make it more than three characters to be sure.

Now it‚Äôs possible to work with your own app‚Äôs currency as a proper money type.

```swift
let bees: Bees = 10_000
print(‚ÄúI have \(bees)‚Äù)
```
> I have üêù10,000

And of course if you have an IAP for purchasing in-app currency, then I‚Äôm sure a custom FX provider would be handy.

Take a look at the example project, Custom Money, for an example of a custom local FX provider to exchange your üêùs.

## Installation
Money builds as a cross platform (iOS, OS X, watchOS) extension compatible framework. It is compatible with [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage). It is also available via CocoaPods

```ruby
pod ‚ÄòMoney‚Äô
```

At of writing there seems to be issues with the CocoaDocs generator for pure Swift 2 projects. This means that the project doesn‚Äôt have a page/docs in CocoaPods sites. 

## Architectural style
Swift is designed to have a focus on safety, enabled primarily through strong typing. This framework fully embraces this ethos and uses generics heavily to achieve this goal. 

At the highest level *currency* is modeled as a protocol, `CurrencyType`. The protocol defines a few static properties like its symbol, and currency code. Therefore *money* is represented as a decimal number with a generic currency. Additionally, we make `CurrencyType` refine the protocol which defines how the decimal number behaves.

Finally, we auto-generate the code which defines all the currencies and money typealiases.

## Implementation Details

Cocoa has two type which can perform decimal arithmetic, these are `NSDecimalNumber` and `NSDecimal`. `NSDecimal` is faster, but is trickier to work with, and doesn‚Äôt have support for limiting the scale of the numbers (which is pretty important when working with currencies).

`DecimalNumberType` is a protocol which refines `SignedNumberType` and defines its own functions, `add`, `subtract` etc to support the arithmetic. It is generic over two types, the underlying storage, and the behaviors.

`DecimalNumberType.DecimalStorageType` exists so that conforming types can utilize either `NSDecimalNumber` or `NSDecimal` as their underling storage type.

`DecimalNumberBehavior` is a protocol which exposes a  [`NSDecimalNumberBehaviors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSDecimalNumberBehaviors_Protocol/) which should be used in calculations. This includes rounding style, scale, and when to throw exceptions.

### `_Decimal`

Which leads us to `_Decimal<Behavior: DecimalNumberBehavior>` which is a value type implementing `DecimalNumberType` with an `NSDecimalNumber` storage type.

There are two public typealiases for convenience.

```swift
/// `Decimal` with plain decimal number behavior
public typealias Decimal = _Decimal<DecimalNumberBehavior.Plain>

/// `BankersDecimal` with banking decimal number behavior
public typealias BankersDecimal = _Decimal<DecimalNumberBehavior.Bankers>
```

This means, that `Decimal` is more than likely the type to use for most things.

### `_Money`
The `_Money<C: CurrencyType>` type composes a `_Decimal<C>`. Its behavior is provided via its generic `CurrencyType` which refines `DecimalNumberBehavior`. `_Money` also conforms to `DecimalNumberType` which means that it can also be used with the operators.

### Why not use `NSDecimal`?
`NSDecimal` would be a better storage type for `_Decimal`, however it doesn‚Äôt have the full `NSDecimalNumberBehaviors` support that `NSDecimalNumber` enjoys. In particular, specifying the scale is problematic. If anyone has any smart ideas, please get in touch. I‚Äôve added an equivalent extension on `NSDecimal` as for `NSDecimalNumber`.

### `ValueCoding`
Both `_Decimal` and `_Money` conform to [`ValueCoding`](https://github.com/danthorpe/ValueCoding) which means they can be encoded and stored inside archives.
