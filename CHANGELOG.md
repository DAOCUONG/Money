# 1.3.0
1. [[MNY-21](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/21), [MNY-22](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/22)]: Adds support for initializing `MoneyType`s with minor units. Thanks to [@jlalvarez18](https://github.com/jlalvarez18).
2. [[MNY-23](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/23)]: Adds some convenience extensions to create Ô£ø pay payment requests using an array of `PaymentSummaryItem` which is a new type generic over `MoneyType`. This is only available on iOS, and it allows consumers to use `Money` directly with Ô£ø pay APIs.
 
# 1.2.1
1. [[MNY-19](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/19)]: Fixes a bunch of miscellaneous spelling mistakes in the README and code documentation.
2. [[MNY-20](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/20)]: Fixes a mistake where DVR which is only needed for the test suit was not in a private Cartfile. Also switches to the official @venmo DVR after recent merges in their project. Thanks to @dasmer for this.

# 1.2.0
1. [[MNY-18](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/18)]: Adds Bitcoin currency types and support for % commission with FX.
	* Creates `BTC` and `XBT` types.
	* Refactors `FXQuote` into a struct (no longer subclass-able) but with a percentage commission property. Commission defaults to 0%.
	* FX method `quote`, now returns `FXTransaction` as the value of the `Result`. This new value type composes the original base money, commission (in the same base money currency), the exchange rate, and the counter money. The type supports `ValueCoding`.
	* A new FX provider, CEX.IO get support for buying and selling bitcoin using `USD`, `EUR` and `RUB`. 

# 1.1.0
1. [[MNY-16](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/16)]: Grab bag of minor issues post 1.0 release.
	* Cleans up some minor mistakes (spelling etc). 
	* Adds `NSCoding` conformance to `FXQuote` - so it can be persisted if needed.
	* Adds `FXRemoteProviderType.quote(: BaseMoney, completion: Result<(BaseMoney, FXQuote, CounterMoney), FXError> -> Void) -> NSURLSessionDataTask` API. This is the nuts and bolts of the FX provider now. It returns as its result, the base money (i.e. the input), the quote (which includes the rate), and the counter money (i.e. the output). The `fx` method still exists, and it just unwraps the tuple to return the counter money. See the updated README.
2. [[MNY-17](https://github.com/danthorpe/Money/pull/17)]: There was an oversight in the functions in `DecimalNumberType` which accepts `NSDecimalNumberBehaviors` as an argument. These were unnecessary so I‚Äôve removed them. Hence the minor version bump.
